## Description

This a a very light JS-script to make perfect photo-galeries, like we can see on Flickr and Google.

It uses CSS3 Flex-box mode and a little JavaScript.
The version pure-CSS is not perfect but still very nice.
The version with JS enhances nicely the display by removing all the white-spaces.

There is no JS prototype, nor is there a real library : the script is so small (20 lines of JS) you don’t need one.

## Quick Notes

- The mathematical problem of a perfectly balanced gallery is called the [partition problem](https://www.crispymtn.com/stories/the-algorithm-for-a-perfectly-balanced-photo-gallery).
- For a more powerfull tool and a real lib, you should look at [FlexImages](https://goodies.pixabay.com/javascript/flex-images/demo.html).
